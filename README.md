<br>
___

**Option B:** To use the application through a GUI, type the following file name on the terminal:
~~~
gui.py
~~~
This is a "Tkinter" based GUI with the following functions:
1. Loads JSON file into the system using the upload button. 
2. Can create and save new data into JSON typing in the component and value field inputs and clicking 
the **Add** or **New** buttons.
3. Can edit, delete and save data selected in the table / tree viewer. 

*Important Notes*
+ The JSON Data that is uploaded will be previewed in the Tkinter's table/tree viewer.
+ The data in the table can be navigated through clicking on the desired data row. 
+ The JSON data consists of nested lists and dictionaries, make sure to click on the (+) sign to preview 
nested keys and values.
+ By clicking on **New** from the file menu, The data will be erased from the table. 

A preview of the GUI can be seen below:

**<u>Cost Estimation Techniques</u>**


Several types of cost estimation techniques are used within the industry, such as:

- COCOMO
- Delphi
- Expert Judgement
- Halstead's software science

For the software aspect of this project, "COCOMO" seems to be the most applicable estimation method. However, 
"COCOMO" relies heavily on **LOC** (Lines of Code) to estimate cost - information which we do not have.

A basic implementation of "COCOMO" can be found in the `cocomo.py` file within this repository.
The code will have to be adjusted to fit our project, depending on which factors we would like to consider.

However, since we are given information about financial cost (for both components and staff),
as well as required person-weeks for design and manufacture, I doubt that using a common estimation algorithm
would bring any benefit, as such algorithms are mainly used to estimate the amount of time needed to complete 
such project. It would make more sense to adopt parts of this algorithm and customize it so that we can accept 
user input in terms of person-weeks, hardware & software components and their costs, and then calculate a total time,
total cost, and total difficulty associated with the project. 

**<u>UML Diagram</u>**

This is a proposed class structure for the cost estimator. 
Note that in this design, we define a HardwareComponent class, a SoftwareComponent class, a StaffMember class, 
and a ProjectEstimator class.

![project_cost_estimator](https://github.com/michaelsammueller/cost-estimation/assets/34138597/6420a93d-c813-49c4-b35e-ba660ca2e2b7)

The ProjectEstimator class is the main class, which hosts all of the calculation and estimation algorithms. Whenever the user opens
the program, an instance of the ProjectEstimator is created. When the user uploads a JSON file into the GUI or CLI, the ProjectEstimator
triggers its 'read_json_data(json_data)' method, which populates the empty 'software_components', 'hardware_components', and 'resources'
dictionaries with the data defined in the JSON file.

Once the user presses the 'Calculate' button on the GUI, or selects the 'Calculate' option in the CLI, all of the ProjectEstimator's
calculation and estimation algorithms are triggered, and their results passed to the user interface to display the final values.

**<u>Testing</u>**

Being a vital aspect of software development, we conducted several tests on our code to ensure correct functionality of our algorithms,
and to double-check adherence to code quality guidelines.

**<u>Unit Tests</u>**

As development progresses and the code becomes more complex, simple 'print' statements aren't enough to test the functionality of code.
While they are still useful and have been used in addition to unit tests, we feel that unit tests are more appropriate to ensure
functionality of code.

Using Python's inbuilt 'unittest' library, we created a 'test_calculations.py' file in addition to several unit tests. By conducting these tests,
we ensure that instances of classes are created as expected, as well as making sure that our calculation algorithms work as expected wherever necessary.

![unittests](https://github.com/michaelsammueller/cost-estimation/assets/34138597/55ff2ea2-fe28-4f1c-b6ac-ecda84c77fe0)

The attached screenshot demonstrates some of the tests which have been written for our back-end code. All of these tests can be found within the
'test_calculations.py' file in this repository.

**<u>pylint</u>**

As part of our testing, we wanted to make sure that our code adheres to Python style guides and the "Zen of Python". Using 'pylint' allowed us to check for
code smells, as well as logical errors and efficiency improvements. The initial run of 'pylint' resulted in a score of 5.68.

![pylint-run-1](https://github.com/michaelsammueller/cost-estimation/assets/34138597/96ac50b3-feba-45bc-8732-c9f76116e4a1)

After making improvements such as removing unnecessary whitespaces and shortening line-lengths, as well as correcting some logical errors and improving the
overall flow of the code, we end up with a total score of 8.20. While there are still aspects of the code which could use improvement, we are satisfied with
the final scoring and will leave any further improvements for a later development stage, as we do not want to alter the code too much and risk losing
core functionality at this stage.
